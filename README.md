# dogculator

Fun challenge if you're curious to know how old you will be in dog years, dog months, or dog days. The input takes your human age (in years) and then converts to the dog equivalent depending on your selected option.

** Assumption: 1 year is equivalent to 10.5 human years.

This short project employs HTML, CSS and JS for design and DOM manipulation. Now, go find out your age in dog years! https://erdookuhwa.github.io/dogculator/
